1. How would you define machine learning?
Building a system that would perform well even on the new data. The system will be reliable with the time

2. Can you name four types of applications where it shines?
Financial. Immense amount of data each miliseconds can be used to understand and predict the market.
Search engine. Able to give correct information long with reccomendations.
Picture identification.
Picture to text. Img to text.

3. What is a labeled training set?
?

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
?

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
classification(plus softmax)
Identifying simiarities and grouping animals.

6. What type of algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
Not sure. Logistic and Relu?

7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?
Softmax.

8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?
Unsupervised learning.

9. What is an online learning system?
When the system/ model learn as the data is collected. Useful when the model needs to adept very frequently, but prone to decrease in performance when bad data is fed.

10. What is out-of-core learning?
?

11. What type of algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?
classification. Usually softmax when multiple classes are needed to be classified.

12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a model hyperparameter?
Model parameters are the co-efficients for the polynomials. Hyperparameters are for things like lambda, replated to regularization to control under fitting and over fitting.

13. What do model-based algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?


14. Can you name four of the main challenges in machine learning?


15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name three possible solutions?
Make test set.
Make validaiton/cross-validaton set.
Feed better data.
Generalize the data.

16. What is a test set, and why would you want to use it?
If the model is trained on the train set, the model would only perform well on the training data. Having the test set, the model can be tested for performance so that the new data can be expected to work well with the model.

17. What is the purpose of a validation set?
For making fair performance evaluations.

18. What is the train-dev set, when do you need it, and how do you use it?


19. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?
